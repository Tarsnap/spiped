spipe usage
===========

usage: spipe -t <target socket> -k <key file> [-f] [-o <connection timeout>]

Options:
    -t <target socket>
	Address to which spiped should connect.
    -k <key file>
	Use the provided key file to authenticate and encrypt.
    -f
	Use fast/weak handshaking: This reduces the CPU time spent in the
	initial connection setup, at the expense of losing perfect forward
	secrecy.
    -o <connection timeout>
	Timeout, in seconds, after which an attempt to connect to the target
	or a protocol handshake will be aborted (and the connection dropped)
	if not completed.  Defaults to 5s.

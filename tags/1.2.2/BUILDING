To build and install spiped, run:
# make BINDIR=/path/to/target/directory install

Spiped should build and run on any IEEE Std 1003.1 (POSIX) compliant
system which
1. Includes the Software Development Utilities option,
2. Has OpenSSL available via -lcrypto and #include <openssl/foo>, and
3. Provides /dev/urandom.

On some platforms (Solaris, maybe others), additional compiler and/or linker
options are required to find OpenSSL or system libraries; these can be
provided by adding e.g., CFLAGS="-I/path/to/openssl/headers" (compiler option)
or LDADD_EXTRA="-L/usr/sfw/lib -lsocket -lnsl" (linker option) to the make
command line.

On some platforms (OpenBSD 5.2 and earlier and HEAD prior to 2012-09-15, and
possibly others) you will need to add #include <sys/types.h> at the start of
spipe/main.c and spipe/pushbits.c, due to a bug on those platforms.

On some platforms (mostly Linuxes) it is possible to install OpenSSL libaries
wihout the associated header files; the header files are usually in packages
named "openssl-devel", "libssl-dev", or similar.

If your OS provides random bytes via some mechanism other than /dev/urandom,
please make local changes to lib/util/entropy.c and notify the author.

If spiped fails to build or run for other reasons, please notify the
author.

To build and install spiped, run:
# make BINDIR=/path/to/target/directory install

Spiped should build and run on any IEEE Std 1003.1 (POSIX) compliant
system which
1. Includes the Software Development Utilities option,
2. Has OpenSSL available via -lcrypto and #include <openssl/foo>, and
3. Provides /dev/urandom.

On some platforms (OS X, maybe others) you will need to remove "-lrt"
from the LDADD= lines in spiped/Makefile and spipe/Makefile, due to a
bug in those platforms.

On some platforms (OpenBSD, maybe others) you will need to add
#include <sys/types.h> at the start of spipe/main.c and spipe/pushbits.c,
due to a bug on those platforms.

If your OS needs extra compiler options to find and use OpenSSL, please
make local changes to the Makefile.  If your OS provides random bytes
via some mechanism other than /dev/urandom, please make local changes to
lib/util/entropy.c and notify the author.

If spiped fails to build or run for other reasons, please notify the
author.

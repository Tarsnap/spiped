.SH NAME
spiped - secure pipe daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B spiped
{\-e | \-d} \-s <source socket>
\-t <target socket>
\-k <key file>
.br
[\-DFj]
[\-f | \-g]
[\-n <max # connections>]
[\-o <connection timeout>]
[\-p <pidfile>]
[\-r <rtime> | \-R]
[\-U <username> | <username:groupname>]

.B spiped
\-v
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-e
Take unencrypted connections from the
.I source socket
and send encrypted connections to the
.IR "target socket" .
.TP
.B \-d
Take encrypted connections from the
.I source socket
and send unencrypted connections to the
.IR "target socket" .
.TP
.B \-s <source socket>
Address on which spiped should listen for incoming connections.  The
accepted formats are the same as the ones accepted by
.IR "target socket" .
Note that contrary to
.I target socket
hostnames are resolved when
.B spiped
is launched and are not re-resolved later; thus if DNS entries change
.B spiped
will continue to accept connections at the expired address.
.TP
.B \-t <target socket>
Address to which
.B spiped
should connect.
Must be in one of the following formats:
.IP \(bu
/absolute/path/to/unix/socket
.IP \(bu
host.name:port
.IP \(bu
[ip.v4.ad.dr]:port
.IP \(bu
[ipv6::addr]:port
.IP
Hostnames are re-resolved every
.I rtime
seconds.
.TP
.B \-k <key file>
Use the provided key file to authenticate and encrypt.
Pass "\-" to read from standard input.
.TP
.B \-D
Wait for DNS.  Normally when
.B spiped
is launched it resolves addresses and binds to its
.I source socket
before the parent process returns; with this option it will daemonize
first and retry failed DNS lookups until they succeed.  This allows
.B spiped
to launch even if DNS isn't set up yet, but at the expense of losing
the guarantee that once
.B spiped
has finished launching it will be ready to create pipes.
.TP
.B \-f
Use fast/weak handshaking: This reduces the CPU time spent in the
initial connection setup by disabling the Diffie-Hellman handshake, at the
expense of losing perfect forward secrecy.
.TP
.B \-g
Require perfect forward secrecy by dropping connections if the other
host is using the \-f option.
.TP
.B \-F
Run in foreground.  This can be useful with systems like daemontools.
.TP
.B \-j
Disable transport layer keep-alives.
(By default they are enabled.)
.TP
.B \-n <max # connections>
Limit on the number of simultaneous connections allowed.
A value of 0 indicates that no limit should be imposed; this may be
inadvisable in some circumstances, since
.B spiped
will terminate if it fails to allocate memory for handling a new
connection.
Defaults to 100 connections.
.TP
.B \-o <connection timeout>
Timeout, in seconds, after which an attempt to connect to the target
or a protocol handshake will be aborted (and the connection dropped)
if not completed.  Defaults to 5s.
.TP
.B \-p <pidfile>
File to which
.BR spiped 's
process ID should be written.  Defaults to
.IR "source socket" .pid
(in the current directory if
.I source socket
is not an absolute path).  No file will be written if -F (run in foreground)
is used.
.TP
.B \-r <rtime>
Re-resolve the address of
.I target socket
every
.I rtime
seconds.
Defaults to re-resolution every 60 seconds.
.TP
.B \-R
Disable target address re-resolution.
.TP
.B \-U <username> | <username:groupname>
After binding a socket, change the user to
.I username
(and optionally the group to
.IR groupname ).
.TP
.B \-v
Print version number.
.SH SIGNALS
spiped provides special treatment of the following signals:
.TP
.B SIGTERM
On receipt of the
.I SIGTERM
signal
.B spiped
will stop accepting new connections and exit once there are
no active connections left.

To build and install spiped, run:
# make BINDIR=/path/to/target/directory install

Spiped should build and run on any IEEE Std 1003.1 (POSIX) compliant
system which
1. Includes the Software Development Utilities option,
2. Has OpenSSL available via -lcrypto and #include <openssl/foo>, and
3. Provides /dev/urandom.

If your OS needs extra compiler options to find and use OpenSSL, please
make local changes to the Makefile.  If your OS provides random bytes
via some mechanism other than /dev/urandom, please make local changes to
lib/util/entropy.c and notify the author.

If spiped fails to build or run for other reasons, please notify the
author.

spiped usage
============

usage: spiped {-e | -d} -s <source socket> -t <target socket> -k <key file>
    [-DfF] [-n <max # connections>] [-o <connection timeout>] [-p <pidfile>]

Options:
    -e
	Take unencrypted connections from the source socket and send
	encrypted connections to the target socket.
    -d
	Take encrypted connections from the source socket and send
	unencrypted connections to the target socket.
    -s <source socket>
	Address on which spiped should listen for incoming connections.
	Must be in one of the following formats:
		/absolute/path/to/unix/socket
		host.name:port
		[ip.v4.ad.dr]:port
		[ipv6::addr]:port
	Note that hostnames are resolved when spiped is launched and are not
	re-resolved later; thus if DNS entries change spiped will continue to
	connect to the expired address.
    -t <target socket>
	Address to which spiped should connect.
    -k <key file>
	Use the provided key file to authenticate and encrypt.
    -D
	Wait for DNS.  Normally when spiped is launched it resolves addresses
	and binds to its source socket before the parent process returns; with
	this option it will daemonize first and retry failed DNS lookups until
	they succeed.  This allows spiped to launch even if DNS isn't set up
	yet, but at the expense of losing the guarantee that once spiped has
	finished launching it will be ready to create pipes.
    -f
	Use fast/weak handshaking: This reduces the CPU time spent in the
	initial connection setup, at the expense of losing perfect forward
	secrecy.
    -F
	Run in foreground.  This can be useful with systems like daemontools.
    -n <max # connections>
	Limit on the number of simultaneous connections allowed.  Defaults
	to 100 connections.
    -o <connection timeout>
	Timeout, in seconds, after which an attempt to connect to the target
	or a protocol handshake will be aborted (and the connection dropped)
	if not completed.  Defaults to 5s.
    -p <pidfile>
	File to which spiped's process ID should be written.  Defaults to
	<source socket>.pid (in the current directory if <source socket> is
	not an absolute path).

spiped-1.5.0
* Attempt to set the TCP_NODELAY socket option on connections, in order
  to avoid punishing latencies from TCP nagling.
spiped-1.4.2
* Fix crash on platforms which support AESNI (i386, amd64) but do not
  automatically provide 16-byte alignment to large memory allocations
  (glibc, possibly others).
spiped-1.4.1
* Fix build on OS X, and improve strict POSIX compliance.
* Improved zeroing of sensitive cryptographic data.
spiped-1.4.0
* Add automatic detection of compiler support (at compile-time) and CPU
  support (at run-time) for x86 "AES New Instructions"; and when available,
  use these to improve cryptographic performance.
* Add support for -g option, which makes {spiped, spipe} require perfect
  forward secrecy by dropping connections if the peer endpoint is detected to
  be running using the -f option.
spiped-1.3.1
* Fix build by adding missing <stdint.h> #include.
* Minor code cleanups.
spiped-1.3.0
* Bug fix: spiped now correctly closes connections which have been reset;
  in earlier versions spiped could erronously hold "dead" connections open
  as long as they remained idle.
* Man pages added.
* Protocol-layer keep-alives are now enabled by default.
* New option -j (spipe/spiped): Disable protocol-layer keep-alives.
* In spiped the target address is now re-resolved every 60 seconds by default.
* New option -R (spiped): Do not re-resolve target address.
* New option -r <rtime> (spiped): Re-resolve target address every <rtime>
  seconds.
spiped-1.2.2
* Build fixes for some strictly POSIX-conforming platforms.
* Detect and work around compilers which are POSIX-noncompliant in their
  handling of -rt and -lxnet options.
* Minor documentation and typo fixes.
spiped-1.2.1
* Fix build by adding missing <stdint.h> #include.
spiped-1.2.0
* New utility "spipe": A client for the spiped protocol, handling a single
  connection with standard input/output as one end.
* Code rearrangement with no functional consequences.
* Minor bug and documentation fixes.
spiped-1.1.0
* New option -D: Wait until DNS lookups succeed.
* New option -F: Don't daemonize.
* Use SO_REUSEADDR to avoid 'socket address already in use' error (most
  importantly, if spiped is killed and restarted).
* Minor bug and style fixes.
spiped-1.0.0
* Initial release

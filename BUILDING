Installing
----------

To build and install spiped, run:
# make BINDIR=/path/to/target/directory install

To install man pages, add MAN1DIR=/path/to/man.1/directory to the command
line (e.g., MAN1DIR=/usr/local/man/man1 on FreeBSD).

Spiped should build and run on any IEEE Std 1003.1 (POSIX) compliant
system which
  1. Includes the Software Development Utilities option,
  2. Has OpenSSL available via -lcrypto and #include <openssl/foo>, and
  3. Provides /dev/urandom.


Platform-specific notes
-----------------------

- On OS X, the version of OpenSSL included with the operating
  system is outdated (0.9.8) and deprecated, and it is recommended
  that spiped be built with an updated version of OpenSSL.  On OS X
  10.11 "El Capitan", OpenSSL was removed entirely.  After installing a newer
  version of OpenSSL, use
      CFLAGS="-I /path/to/openssl/headers"
      LDADD_EXTRA="-L /path/to/openssl/lib"
  to build spiped.

  Note that spiped will still build (on pre-10.11) if you set these options
  wrong: If you see
      warning: 'AES_set_encrypt_key' is deprecated
  during the build then spiped is still using the outdated version
  of OpenSSL from OS X.

- On Cygwin the following command must be run before building spiped in order
  order to work around a bug in Cygwin's C library:
      sed -i.orig s/-D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L// */Makefile
  Without this command, spiped will still build but it will crash.

- On some platforms (Solaris, maybe others), additional compiler and/or linker
  options are required to find OpenSSL or system libraries; these can be
  provided by adding e.g., CFLAGS="-I/path/to/openssl/headers" (compiler option)
  or LDADD_EXTRA="-L/usr/sfw/lib -lsocket -lnsl" (linker option) to the make
  command line.

- On Solaris, the command-line utilities in /usr/bin are not
  necessarily POSIX-compatible.  According to standards(7), in order to use
  POSIX.1-2008 standard-conforming utilities, you must set your PATH so that
  certain directories (such as /usr/xpg4/bin/) take precedence over /usr/bin.
  Please check the documentation in your version of Solaris by:
      $ man standards
  and carefully read the "Utilities" section.

- On some platforms (OpenBSD prior to 5.4, and possibly others) you will need to
  add #include <sys/types.h> at the start of
	lib/dnsthread/dnsthread.c
	libcperciva/util/sock_util.c
	proto/proto_conn.c
	spipe/main.c
	spipe/pushbits.c
  due to a POSIX-compliance bug on those platforms.

- On some platforms (mostly Linuxes) it is possible to install OpenSSL libraries
  without the associated header files; the header files are usually in packages
  named "openssl-devel", "libssl-dev", or similar.

- If your OS provides random bytes via some mechanism other than /dev/urandom,
  please make local changes to lib/util/entropy.c and notify the author.

If spiped fails to build or run for other reasons, please notify the
author.


Updating build code and releasing
---------------------------------

The POSIX-compatible Makefiles are generated via `make Makefiles` from the
included (far more readable) BSD Makefiles.  To run this target, you will
need to have a BSD `make(1)` utility; NetBSD's `make(1)` is available for many
operating systems as `bmake`.

Release tarballs are generated via `make VERSION=x.y.z publish`, subject
to the same caveat of needing a BSD-compatible make.
